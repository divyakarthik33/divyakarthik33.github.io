    Since I was a little girl, I have always had a passion for curiousity and creativity. Whether it be being the leader of constructing IKEA furniture or the creater of several make your own game - games, I have always known that I wanted my career path to allow me to innovate on a daily. This led me to explore the engineering, but even within this field, computer science naturally appealed to me due to it's versatility in several industries. Doing work that yields transformative impact and results is what's rewarding for me, which makes the company I work for and their mission is extremely important to me.<br><br>
    
    <font  color="lightsteelblue">Technical Career Goals and Interests:</font> <br>
    With programming and solution design as the backbone, I'm into <b>full stack product development</b> (especially by using and learning different technologies), <b>data visualization and analytics</b>, and <b>user experience innovation</b>. I'm interested in roles that allow me to design and implement software solutions that push a business forward and by direct transitivity impact lives.
